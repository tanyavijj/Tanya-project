Image Super-Resolution using SRGAN and Enhanced Models
This project demonstrates the use of Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) for enhancing low-resolution images. The goal is to first replicate the results from the original SRGAN paper by Ledig et al., and then improve the model by incorporating techniques from the ESRGAN paper to enhance image quality further.
